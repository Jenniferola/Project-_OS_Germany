    "- Bojkotter: Under vissa OS under den tiden var det internationella politiska klimatet ansträngt, och vissa länder deltog inte av politiska skäl. Ett exempel på detta var bojkotterna av Olympiska sommarspelen 1980 i Moskva och Olympiska sommarspelen 1984 i Los Angeles.\n",

    "- Politiska förändringar: Tyskland upplevde politiska förändringar under den aktuella tidsperioden. Mellan 1964 och 1992 var Tyskland delat i två stater: Västtyskland (FRG) och Östtyskland (DDR). Dessa två tyska staterna tävlade ofta som separata enheter vid olympiska evenemang.\n",
